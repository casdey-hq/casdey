  /**
   * Why this form refuses the reset React fires after an action.
   *
   * That reset moves the DOM somewhere React cannot see. Three controls here
   * are drawn from state, and a controlled `<select>` carries its choice as a
   * property rather than a `selected` attribute, so a reset drops it back to
   * the first option, which is "months". State still says "days", so no
   * setter changes anything, React re-renders nothing, and the select keeps
   * showing a unit the gym did not pick: saving "90 days" left the form
   * reading "90 months", one Save away from submitting a window nobody chose.
   * The visit-ceiling checkbox has the same shape, and used to tick itself
   * back on for the same reason. Since the number field beside it is disabled
   * while the box is off, and a disabled field is never submitted, the next
   * save then reported a ceiling out of range that the gym had never typed.
   *
   * Re-syncing state on the reset event cannot fix any of this, and that is
   * measured rather than assumed: by the time the reset fires, the new row
   * has already arrived and state already matches it, so every setter is a
   * no-op and the DOM keeps what the reset put there.
   *
   * Refusing the reset is the fix, and the event is cancelable. Nothing is
   * lost by refusing: after a successful save the fields already hold exactly
   * what was saved, and after a failed one the gym keeps what it typed
   * instead of having it wiped.
