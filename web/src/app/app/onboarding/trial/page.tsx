 * The second half of signup: buying the first week.

 * reaches a card field. That includes the figure it will be charged at the end
 * of the week, which is the number people actually care about and the one most
 * trials bury.
 *
 * The week is sold rather than given, which is the whole design. A gym that
 * pays something, even 1 euro, and answers "yes, I'll stay if this works" is a
 * different gym from one that clicked a button. It probably costs a few
 * signups. The ones it costs were never going to import a member list.
