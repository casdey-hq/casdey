/**
 * The forward figure on the Overview: roughly what the gym's currently-lapsed
 * members represent in monthly membership revenue.
 *
 * "Revenue recovered" (src/lib/revenue.ts) looks backward and is exact, summed
 * one real booking at a time. This looks forward and is an estimate, and it is
 * built to stay honest about that.
 *
 * Where the per-member number comes from, without inventing it: the gym's own
 * priced recurring memberships. Each active recurring service is reduced to a
 * monthly figure. When the gym has recorded a current-member count for every
 * one, those counts produce a weighted average. Otherwise the MEDIAN is used
 * as the conservative fallback. That number is multiplied by the lapsed count.
 *
 *   - It is not a value the gym typed into a box. D1 #12/#13 removed that field
 *     because an unverifiable input made casdey look useless or miraculous
 *     depending on the guess, and on Pro it created guarantee liability against
 *     a made-up number. The median here is computed from prices the gym also
 *     quotes to its own members on the booking page, so inflating it is not
 *     free.
 *   - It never touches the guarantee or "Revenue recovered". It is a display
 *     figure and nothing reads it back.
 *   - The weighted average reflects a gym's real membership mix. The median
 *     fallback stops one €400 corporate plan among €40 memberships dragging an
 *     unknown mix upward.
 *
 * A gym with no recurring membership priced gets `priced: false` and the
 * Overview shows a prompt to add one rather than a fabricated number.
