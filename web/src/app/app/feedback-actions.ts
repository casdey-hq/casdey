 * read today.
 *
 * The write wins and the email is best effort: a gym that took the trouble to
 * type something must never be told it failed because a mail API was down. The
 * row is already saved by then, and it is the copy that matters.
 *
 * Sends over Zoho rather than Resend deliberately. Resend's plan is capped at
 * 100 emails a day and the live cold outreach is already eating 75 of them, so
 * casdey's own internal notifications must not compete with a gym's actual
 * campaign for that allowance.
