/**
 * Whether a gym has a payment sitting unpaid because its bank wants the owner
 * to authorise it, and the link that lets them do it.
 *
 * **This is a designed-for path, not an edge case**, which is why it has its
 * own module rather than living inside the billing page. Under PSD2 a European
 * issuer decides for itself whether to waive authentication on an off-session
 * renewal, and casdey's first week costs 1 euro while the renewal costs a few
 * hundred. Stripe's exemption for recurring charges is the FIXED AMOUNT one,
 * which wants every charge in the series to be the same, so casdey's own shape
 * argues against itself and a challenge at the first renewal should be
 * expected rather than hoped against. Confirmed the hard way on 2026-09-12: a
 * real Revolut card refused the exemption on both architectures tried.
 *
 * Shopify does exactly this too, and emails a link. casdey emails one as well
 * (see email/trial-auth.ts), but an email is a thin place for the only copy of
 * something that silently stops a gym sending, so the product says it too.
 *
 * Read live from Stripe rather than stored, deliberately. The alternative is a
 * column that has to be kept in step with an invoice whose state changes
 * without casdey being involved, and a stale "authorise your payment" banner
 * pointing at an invoice that is already paid is worse than none.
