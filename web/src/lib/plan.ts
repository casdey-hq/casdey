/**
 * The offer model: trial → free → a paid tier (Standard or Pro).
 *
 * Dictated by Davide (see CLAUDE.md "Offer evolution"; 3-tier move Sept 2026):
 *
 *   - A new gym in the V1/waitlist window gets ONE WEEK of the top tier, free,
 *     no card. It is meant to show the whole product working.
 *   - When that week ends the account drops to a FREE plan that is deliberately
 *     crippled: it can still find lapsed members and see the money sitting on
 *     the table, but it cannot send. The gap is the pitch.
 *   - Upgrading is a real Stripe subscription to Standard or Pro. Gyms who
 *     joined in the V1/waitlist window keep a lifetime 20% discount on either
 *     paid tier.
 *   - In V2 the free week goes away for new signups.
 *
 * The two levers that move with the business, whether new signups get a trial
 * and whether the early-adopter discount is still handed out, are environment
 * flags, not code edits.
 *
 * The access STATE is DERIVED from the gym row, never stored, for the same
 * reason lapse is derived: a stored state goes stale the moment a trial
 * silently expires or a subscription lapses. `effectivePlan` is the one place
 * that decides it. The paid TIER (Standard vs Pro) is the one thing that must
 * be stored (`gyms.plan_tier`), because it comes from the Stripe subscription
 * price and cannot be recomputed from the gym row.

 * The paid first week (Track H): signup takes a card, charges 1 euro for seven
 * days of Pro, asks for a commitment, and converts to Pro at day 7 unless the
 * gym cancelled.
 *
 * Defaults OFF, unlike the two flags around it, and that asymmetry is the
 * point. This one changes what happens to a real card at signup, so it ships
 * dark and Davide turns it on deliberately once the live Stripe path has been
 * walked end to end. With it off, signup behaves exactly as it did before:
 * free week, no card, drop to Free.
 *
 * Named for what it is now. It was `trialPenaltyEnabled` /
 * `CASDEY_TRIAL_PENALTY` until 2026-09-12, when the setup fee was removed from
 * the design (see the note at the top of src/lib/trial.ts). Renaming an env var
 * is usually not worth the churn; it was here because the variable had never
 * been set in any environment, so nothing had to be migrated, and a flag called
 * TRIAL_PENALTY guarding a mechanism with no penalty in it would have been
 * actively misleading to the next person.
 *
 * The public marketing site follows this flag: every price claim on it reads
 * `paidTrialEnabled()`, with the repeated strings in ./offer-copy.ts. Anything
 * new that states a price has to do the same, or the site, the terms page and
 * the checkout end up telling three different stories, which is the failure
 * caught on the day casdey.com was published (the homepage promised a Pro-only
 * guarantee with no qualifier). `SiteHeader`, `PricingTable` and `AuthForm` are
 * client components and take the flag as a required prop instead.
 *
 * Note /terms/refunds is statically prerendered, so the flag needs a redeploy
 * to change the page as well as the behaviour.
 *
 * See src/lib/trial.ts for the mechanism and web/SAAS_V1_1_PLAN.md Track H.
