/*
 * The member-data counterpart to /privacy, which covers the waitlist only and

 * "not transferred outside the UK or EEA", which is only true once the Vercel
 * function region is pinned to the EU (Dublin). Until that is confirmed, the doc
 * states only where the data is stored (EU/Ireland), which is true regardless.
 * Restore the stronger EEA-only claim once the Vercel region is set to dub1.

              Data processing terms
            </h1>
            <P>
              These terms cover member data. They apply from the moment a gym
              uploads its first member list and sit alongside the{" "}
              <Link
                href="/privacy"
                className="text-teal underline underline-offset-4"
              >
                privacy notice
              </Link>
              , which covers only the details a gym gives us about itself.
            </P>

            <H2>Who is responsible for what</H2>
            <P>
              The gym is the data controller. It decides which members are
              uploaded, what is said to them, and when. casdey, operated by the
              casdey team and reachable at info@casdey.com, is the processor: it
              acts on the gym&apos;s instructions and does nothing with member
              data that the gym has not asked for.
            </P>
            <P>
              A gym confirms this, and confirms it has a lawful basis to contact
              these members about their membership, before casdey will accept a
              single record. The product refuses the upload otherwise.
            </P>

            <H2>What casdey holds</H2>
            <List
              items={[
                "Member name, email address and phone number, as given in the gym's own export.",
                "The date of their last visit and how many visits are on record.",
                "The gym's own reference for that member, where their software provides one.",
                "What casdey has done: which messages were sent and when, whether a member unsubscribed, and whether the gym recorded them as having returned.",
              ]}
            />
            <P>
              casdey does not hold health records, training or medical notes,
              images or payment details, and has no way to receive them.
            </P>

            <H2>What it is used for</H2>
            <P>
              One purpose: identifying members who have not been seen for a
              while and contacting them on the gym&apos;s behalf to invite them
              back. Member data is never sold, never shared with another gym,
              never used for advertising, and never used to train any model.
            </P>

            <H2>Where it is held</H2>
            <P>
              Your member data is stored in the European Union, in Ireland,
              encrypted in transit and at rest.
            </P>

            <H2>Who else touches it</H2>
            <P>
              casdey uses these sub-processors, and no others. Each is bound by
              equivalent terms.

                  United States. A gym that leaves WhatsApp off shares nothing

                  in two places, both of which the gym turns on itself. If the
                  gym asks casdey to write each message individually, it
                  receives the gym&apos;s own message and the few facts casdey
                  holds about that member: their first name, roughly how long
                  since their last visit, the reason for leaving if the gym
                  recorded one, and the gym&apos;s offer. If the gym turns on
                  the WhatsApp channel, it also receives the text of a
                  conversation once a member has replied. In both cases it
                  receives the gym&apos;s name, processes in the United States,
                  and is contractually barred from training on any of it. A gym
                  that leaves individual writing off and WhatsApp off shares
                  nothing with Anthropic.

            <H2>Member rights</H2>
            <P>
              A member&apos;s rights are exercised against the gym, which is
              their controller. casdey will help a gym answer any request, at no
              charge and without delay. Every message casdey sends carries a
              working unsubscribe link, and using it stops all contact from that
              gym through casdey immediately, including anything already queued.
            </P>

            <H2>If something goes wrong</H2>
            <P>
              casdey will tell the affected gym about any personal data breach
              without undue delay and in any case within 24 hours of becoming
              aware of it, with what is known at the time, and will keep the gym
              updated. Reporting to a supervisory authority is the gym&apos;s
              decision to make as controller, and casdey will provide whatever
              it needs to make it.
            </P>

            <H2>Ending the arrangement</H2>
            <P>
              A gym can export everything at any time and delete everything at
              any time, both from within the product. On account closure, member
              data is deleted within 30 days without needing to be asked.
            </P>
