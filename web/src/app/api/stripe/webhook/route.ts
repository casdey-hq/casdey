/**
 * Stripe's view of the world, written back onto the gym.
 *
 * This endpoint is the only thing that may change `subscription_status`.
 * Anything else guessing at it ends up with an account that says "active" while
 * Stripe says the card bounced three weeks ago.
 *
 * Three things this has to get right:
 *
 *   1. Verify the signature against the raw body. Parsing the JSON first and
 *      re-serialising it changes the bytes and the signature no longer matches,
 *      which is why `request.text()` is used and not `request.json()`.
 *   2. Be idempotent. Stripe retries, and events can arrive out of order or
 *      twice. Every event id is recorded, and a repeat is dropped.
 *   3. Never fail loudly at Stripe for something that is our problem. A 500
 *      makes Stripe retry for days; a 200 with a logged error does not.
