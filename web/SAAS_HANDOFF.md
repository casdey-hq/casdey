# casdey SaaS — build handoff

What the product is, how the offer works in code, what's verified, and the
env vars needed to run it. Rewritten 2026-09-03 for the gym/fitness product
(the earlier version described the pre-pivot dental build and is superseded).

> **The path to a ready V1 lives in `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md`** (the single source of
> truth: Track A build / B ops / C prod-verify / D Davide's walkthrough).
> Business, pricing, infrastructure and outreach context live in the root
> `CLAUDE.md`. This file is the product/deployment reference those two point at.

## What it is

A SaaS for **gyms and fitness studios**: it finds **lapsed members** (came once
or twice, or cancelled, and never came back), re-engages them by email in the
gym's own name, and books returns straight into the gym's calendar. Built into
the same Next.js app as the marketing site, under `/app`. Domain model:
**gym / member / booking / service / lapsed / returned** (the dental model —
practice / patient / appointment / dormant — was renamed throughout in the
2026-08 pivot; see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Deployment state (env-var detail as of 2026-09-03, corrected 2026-09-21)

- **casdey.com is fully public since 2026-09-07.** The `/` → `/waitlist`
  redirect was deleted from `next.config.ts` (only a `/homepage` → `/` alias
  remains), so the landing page, `/pricing`, `/app`, `/login`, `/book/*`,
  `/u/*`, `/terms/*` and `/privacy` are all reachable. `/waitlist` keeps its
  URL because cold outreach links to it. The product UI refresh (v5 charcoal
  workspace, HQ and landing) is merged to `main` and live (PR #1, 2026-09-21).
- **Email + billing env vars are set in Vercel Production** and `/app` serves:
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CASDEY_SENDING_ADDRESS`, `CRON_SECRET`. Email/password
  auth works in prod; auth transactional email routes through Resend custom
  SMTP. **The 3-tier Stripe config is now live too (F2 done 2026-09-04):**
  the live catalogue (casdey Standard, casdey Pro, 8 prices, the
  `casdey_early_20pct` 20%-forever coupon, replaced on 2026-09-12 by
  `casdey_early_20pct_plans`, which is restricted to the two paid products)
  exists, and all 9 vars
  (`STRIPE_PRICE_{STANDARD,PRO}_{EUR,GBP}_{MONTH,YEAR}` +
  `STRIPE_COUPON_PERCENT`) are set in Vercel Production and Preview. The 6
  retired vars were removed, so Production carried exactly 11 `STRIPE_*` vars
  then: 8 prices, 1 coupon, secret key, webhook secret. Four USD prices were
  added on 2026-09-19 for the US market, so it is 15 now (12 prices). Verified by
  `npm run check:stripe` against the live key.
  **Check the result with `npm run check:stripe`** rather than by eye: it calls
  Stripe and confirms all 9 values resolve to real, active, correctly-priced
  objects in that key's mode, catching the hand-entry mistakes (missing var,
  test id in live config, product id instead of price id, duplicate ids, wrong
  amount, archived price, fixed-amount coupon). Read-only and safe against the
  live account; exits non-zero on any problem.
- **Google Calendar is now wired in prod (2026-09-03, plan item B2 done).**
  `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` and
  `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY` are set in Vercel Production and deployed; Settings →
  Booking shows "Connected as info@casdey.com" and booking can read/write Google
  Calendar in prod (currently the info@casdey.com connection). **The consent
  screen is published to production (B1 done, 2026-09-03), with no verification
  review required**, so real gym owners can connect and refresh tokens no longer
  die after 7 days. **Standing rule:** `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY` must be
  byte-identical in Vercel and local `web/.env.local` — local dev and prod share
  the same Supabase DB, and that key encrypts calendar tokens at rest, so a
  mismatched key shows "Connected" but silently fails to decrypt.
- **WhatsApp was removed in the pivot, then revived for V1 (Track E1, commit
  `cd0fd70`)** after an engaged lead asked for it. The channel code is back
  gym-native, migration `0014` is applied to the live DB, and the UI (Settings
  → WhatsApp, a channel switch on the new-campaign form, a test-send, a
  member-page conversation card) is wired. **B8 is done (2026-09-04):** the
  Twilio account is off trial (`type: Full`, $20 balance, verified via the API),
  and `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are in
  Vercel Production and Preview. It still does not send in prod, and the blocker
  is no longer billing: it needs a **Meta-approved WhatsApp sender and an
  approved template** (the account has 0 numbers, 0 messaging services, 0
  templates), and the inbound webhook is configured on that sender.
  `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` is deliberately unset in Vercel so the channel stays
  honestly disabled rather than claiming to be enabled — see `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md`
  B8. Until then it degrades cleanly.
- **Database:** one Supabase project (`lxnzktbnustbimhdoyyw`, EU/Ireland
  eu-west-1) backs the waitlist and the SaaS. Migrations exist through `0045`
  and are applied to the live project (`0011` dental→gym rename, `0012` at-risk
  campaigns, `0013` cancellation reason, `0014` WhatsApp channel revival,
  `0015` booking overlap guard, `0016` `plan_tier` for 3-tier pricing, `0017`
  per-gym sending identity, `0040` USD, `0041` casdey HQ tables, `0042` check-in
  timing decoupled from the lapse window, `0043` lapsed revenue weighted by
  membership mix, `0044` `internal_plan_tier`, `0045` support conversations).
  Each was applied in a verified transaction over `SUPABASE_DB_URL`; the
  newest tables and columns (`hq_todos`, `support_conversations`,
  `internal_plan_tier`) were re-confirmed present on 2026-09-21. The full list
  is `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Vercel plan confirmed Hobby (2026-09-03, plan item B5 done).** The
  campaign-send route has five once-a-day schedules in `vercel.json` (03, 08,
  13, 16 and 19 UTC, since 2026-09-19), each within Hobby's once-a-day-per-job
  cap, and a gym only sends between 8am and 8pm in its own timezone
  (`src/lib/send-window.ts`). The trial job runs on the 03:00 schedule only.

## The offer model (implemented) — see `src/lib/plan.ts`, and `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md` §F0

**3 tiers as of 2026-09-03 (Track F): trial → Free → Standard/Pro.** The
*access state* is **derived from the gym row, never stored** (`effectivePlan`);
the *paid tier* is stored on `gyms.plan_tier` (migration `0016`), written by the
Stripe webhook. `capabilities(gym)` is the single source of truth for what a gym
can do — a per-plan table.

**The webhook resolves the tier from two sources, deliberately (fix 2026-09-04,
commit `223b821`).** Primary is the subscription's price id, reverse-matched
against the `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars; fallback is `plan_tier` stamped into
`subscription_data.metadata` by `/api/stripe/checkout`. The single-source version
failed open in the expensive direction: those 9 env vars are entered by hand
(F2), and one missing or mistyped Standard var resolved to nothing, left
`plan_tier` null, and `plan.ts` reads a null tier on an active subscription as
**`pro`**, a €99 Standard gym silently getting WhatsApp and the refundable
guarantee. The price id still wins whenever it resolves; the metadata only
catches the misconfiguration. Covered by `src/lib/stripe.test.ts` (11 tests over
the mapping, the 8-price table and `couponIdFor`, half-configured cases
included), which needed `server-only` aliased to `test/server-only-stub.ts` in
`vitest.config.mts` to make `stripe.ts` importable under vitest.

- **First week (trial):** 7 days of the **full Pro feature set**. **Since
  2026-09-12 production sells it for €1** (V1.1 Track H, `CASDEY_PAID_TRIAL`
  set in Vercel Production). Signup is one Stripe Checkout session in
  subscription mode: it takes a card, charges €1 on-session, and creates the
  Pro subscription with a 7-day Stripe trial and the early-adopter coupon.
  Stripe bills day 7 itself. Cancelling during the week costs nothing
  (`cancelTrial()` cancels in Stripe before writing casdey's own flag). If a
  renewal needs 3-D Secure, the gym gets an email from
  `invoice.payment_action_required` and an "Approve €X payment" button on the
  billing page (`src/lib/payment-action.ts`). With the flag off, the old
  casdey-managed week runs instead: no card, then Free. Gyms who signed up
  under the no-card terms keep them. See `SAAS_V1_1_PLAN.md` Track H.
- **Free plan** (after the week): import + see the lapsed **count**, **cannot
  send**; only the first `FREE_MEMBER_LIST_LIMIT` (5) members shown by name;
  `MEMBER_IMPORT_LIMIT.free` = **50** total (net-new cap at import).
- **Standard — €99/mo** (£89; €990/yr): email win-back + at-risk campaigns,
  casdey-owned booking, `MEMBER_IMPORT_LIMIT.standard` = **200**. No WhatsApp,
  no guarantee.
- **Pro — €289/mo** (£249; €2,890/yr): everything in Standard **plus the
  WhatsApp channel and the profit-or-nothing guarantee**,
  `MEMBER_IMPORT_LIMIT.pro` = **2,000** (capped, not unlimited — WhatsApp
  opener cost, see §F0).
- **Early-adopter discount:** a flat **lifetime 20% off** either paid tier — a
  single currency-agnostic `STRIPE_COUPON_PERCENT` (replaces the old
  per-currency £50/€59 fixed coupons; `couponIdFor()` still falls back to them).
- **Existing "Premium" accounts → Pro** (backfilled by `0016`).
- **Three env levers, not code:** `CASDEY_TRIAL_ENABLED` and
  `CASDEY_EARLY_ADOPTER_DISCOUNT` (both default on for V1; set `"false"` for V2),
  plus `CASDEY_PAID_TRIAL` (default **off** in code, the odd one out, because it
  changes what a real card is charged at signup; **set in Vercel Production
  since 2026-09-12**).
  `early_adopter` is persisted per-gym so eligibility survives into V2.
- **Live as of 2026-09-04 (F2):** the products, prices and coupon exist in
  Stripe live mode and their 9 env vars are in Vercel. Built by
  `npm run setup:stripe -- --live` (the old blanket live-key refusal is now an
  explicit opt-in flag), verified by `npm run check:stripe`.
- **Test mode exists** (corrected 2026-09-12): `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in
  `web/.env.local` is a `sk_test_` key and its catalogue resolves, so a local
  checkout charges nobody. The live key is kept separately, as
  `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE`.

## Sending identity: the gym, never casdey (Track G, 2026-09-04)

A member must hear from their gym. Migration `0017` made that true on both
channels; before it, email showed the gym's *name* on casdey's address, and
WhatsApp showed "casdey" outright because the display name belongs to the
sender number rather than the message.

- **Email.** `gyms.sending_domain` + `sending_domain_status`. The gym verifies
  its own domain through Resend (`src/lib/email/domains.ts`), casdey shows the
  DNS records, and `src/lib/email/identity.ts` decides the From address. Only
  `verified` is used — `pending` is treated as unset on purpose. No domain
  configured still sends, under the gym's name on casdey's domain, exactly as
  before. Settings → Sending.
- **WhatsApp.** `gyms.whatsapp_from`, the gym's own sender.
  `whatsappProvider(from)` cannot be constructed without one. Onboarding is
  manual per gym and the opener template is approved under the gym's own
  WhatsApp Business Account, so templates are per-gym, not shared.
- **Not casdey's identity, deliberately:** the new-booking notice that goes to
  the *gym* still comes from casdey, because there casdey really is the sender.

## What's verified

- `tsc` / `lint` / `next build` clean; **`npm run test` 509/509** as of
  2026-09-21 (was 164 on 2026-09-04; dormancy/lapse, CSV parsing + platform headers, phone
  normalisation, the plan model, the Free import cap, the setup checklist,
  calendar availability, the Stripe price→tier mapping, and more — the number is
  a floor, it moves per session).
- The **full customer path was walked end-to-end pre-pivot** (2026-08-16):
  signup → import → lapsed detection → campaign → Stripe checkout → guarantee
  claim → refund → Google Calendar booking. **It was re-walked after the gym
  rebuild:** Davide's own walkthrough (plan Track D1, 2026-09-06 to 2026-09-07,
  70 findings, all closed, record in `D1_WALKTHROUGH.md`) and a real live-mode
  checkout, refund and cancellation (Track C1, 2026-09-07). The paid first week
  was then run live end to end on 2026-09-12. What has never happened is a real
  gym importing its own member list.
- The self-serve onboarding surfaces (first-run setup checklist, import wizard,
  Free-plan locks, booking fail-closed, support FAQ) were verified in the local
  browser 2026-09-03.

## To run / go live — env vars

In `web/.env.local` (local) or Vercel (production):

- **Supabase:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (bare project URL, **not** with a
  `/rest/v1` suffix — the code now rejects that), `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- **Google OAuth (sign-in):** an OAuth client in Supabase → Auth → Providers →
  Google. Email/password works without it; the Google button needs it. The
  consent screen was published to production on 2026-09-03 (plan B1, no
  verification review needed).
- **Stripe:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, twelve
  `STRIPE_PRICE_{STANDARD,PRO}_{EUR,GBP,USD}_{MONTH,YEAR}` (USD added
  2026-09-19), `STRIPE_COUPON_PERCENT`
  (`casdey_early_20pct_plans` since 2026-09-12), and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
  The webhook endpoint sits on `www.casdey.com`, never the apex. It must include
  **`invoice.paid`** (feeds `premium_started_at` + `subscription_payments`,
  which the guarantee needs) and, since 2026-09-12,
  **`invoice.payment_action_required`** (the paid week's authentication email)
  and **`charge.refunded`** (so a refund made in the Stripe dashboard updates
  `subscription_payments.refunded_minor`).
  The handler fetches invoices with `expand: ["payments"]`.
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** + **`CASDEY_SENDING_ADDRESS`**: campaign + auth email via
  Resend (`mail.casdey.com`). Without the key, campaign email falls back to Zoho,
  which can't set a per-gym reply-to. This key is Sending-access-only on purpose.
- **`RESEND_ADMIN_API_KEY`**: a second Resend key with **Full access**, used only
  by Settings → Sending to register and verify a gym's own domain (G1). The
  sending key cannot do this — Resend answers `401 restricted_api_key` on every
  `/domains` call with it — so per-gym sending silently cannot work without this
  one. Two keys rather than one so the credential in the hot send path cannot
  delete other gyms' sending domains. Verify with `npm run check:resend`.
- **`CRON_SECRET`**: guards `POST /api/cron/send` (drains the send queue);
  `vercel.json` registers the daily cron.
- **Google Calendar (booking):** `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` (reuse the "casdey web" OAuth client with the
  Calendar scopes + redirect URIs added), and `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY` (AES-256 key
  encrypting stored Google tokens: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"`).
  Set locally and in Vercel Production (B2, done 2026-09-03). Without them, Settings → Booking shows
  "not set up" and booking runs on casdey's own records only. The requested
  scope is `calendar.app.created` + `calendar.freebusy` (narrowed 2026-09-03).
- **Offer flags:** `CASDEY_TRIAL_ENABLED` / `CASDEY_EARLY_ADOPTER_DISCOUNT` —
  unset for V1, `"false"` for V2. `CASDEY_PAID_TRIAL`: set in Vercel
  Production since 2026-09-12 (the €1 paid week). Changing it needs a real
  rebuild, `npx vercel --prod --force` from the repo root, because
  `/terms/refunds` is prerendered and `vercel redeploy` reuses the build cache.

## Local testing

Dev server on `:3000` (`.claude/launch.json`, name `casdey-web`). A confirmed
test account `test@casdey.com` / `casdey-test-1234` exists (skips email
confirmation) — it is the "Bridge Street Gym" fixture, currently on the Free
plan with a small member list, useful for exercising the Free-plan locks. Local
dev points at the live cloud DB (no local Postgres), so `/app` against real data
needs migrations applied there.

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- **Real gym-software sync** (Mindbody/Glofox/TeamUp/ABC APIs, and LegitFit) —
  the Mindbody adapter is a stub; **CSV export is the real, universal import
  path** for V1, and for LegitFit it is the *only* path — **E2 exited to V2 on
  2026-09-04**: LegitFit publishes no developer API and its Zapier app is
  trigger-only, so nothing can pull a gym's existing member list. See
  `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md` E2.
- **SMS**, invoicing, and any real PMS-diary write other than Google Calendar.
- The **win-back / comeback-offer** interactive page (roadmap #10) — a post-V1
  idea, not started.
