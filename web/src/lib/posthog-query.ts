 * ingestion-only host events are sent to, and the private REST API this file
 * calls (POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID + POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY) lives on the
 * corresponding app host instead (https://eu.posthog.com) — PostHog's own
 * docs: "eu.i.posthog.com for public endpoints and eu.posthog.com for
 * private ones." The ".i." is the whole difference, so it is stripped rather
 * than hand-maintaining a second host env var that could drift from the first.
 *

 * configured or a request fails: /admin then says so in words instead of
