    q: "What happens when a member replies?",
    a: "casdey handles it end to end, including the booking. It replies in your name, finds a slot in your class schedule, and confirms it with the member. Your team only sees a booked class, not a thread to manage.",

  {
    q: "What does casdey need access to?",
    a: "Your member list, to find who has cancelled, and your calendar, to book them into a class. We also connect to your membership pricing, so what comes back can be measured against what was spent, which is how the profit-or-nothing guarantee gets checked.",

    q: "Does our team have to change how it works?",
    a: "No. Once it is connected, casdey reads your records and books straight into your class schedule. Nobody at the gym has to remember to do anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost after the free week?",
    a: "Your account drops to a Free plan, not a bill: you keep importing your list and seeing who has cancelled at no cost. If you want casdey writing to them and booking them into a class, pick a paid plan whenever you're ready, and joining the waitlist locks in a lifetime 20% discount for as long as you stay subscribed. Either way it is the only spend, no ad budget needed, and on the top plan, if it does not recover more than it costs, you do not pay.",

    q: "Is it live yet?",
