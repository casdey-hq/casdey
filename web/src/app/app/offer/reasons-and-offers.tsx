 * a price-sensitive offer had to find a different card first to invent the
 * reason. One section now, reasons at the top, and each reason carries its own
 * offer directly underneath it.

 * Every reason belongs to the gym, casdey's original six included. They can be
 * renamed, reworded, deleted and added to, which is what #46 asked for and
