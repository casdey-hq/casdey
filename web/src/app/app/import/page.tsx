/**
 * Where a direct sync actually stands, per platform (D1 walkthrough #31).
 *
 * Written from what each vendor publishes, because "coming soon" over a single
 * logo was telling every gym the same thing and it was not true for any of
 * them. The three cases are genuinely different:
 *
 *   - Mindbody has a real, documented API, and four gates in front of it:
 *     Mindbody's own review of casdey as a partner, a card on file, a metered
 *     per-call charge, and an activation code that each individual studio has
 *     to turn on from its own Manager Tools. Buildable, and not a small job.
 *   - TeamUp gives a gym its own API credentials from Settings, at no cost and
 *     with nobody's approval. This is the one that is genuinely easy, and it
 *     is first when a gym on TeamUp actually asks for it.
 *   - LegitFit publishes no developer API at all. Its Zapier app is
 *     trigger-only, so it can tell casdey about a booking that happens from now
 *     on and can never hand over the members who already lapsed, which is the
 *     entire list casdey needs. CSV is not a stopgap there, it is the only way.
