name: check-up
description: >-
  Pulls a live, single-pass snapshot of how casdey is actually doing right
  now — marketing/outreach performance, product and revenue numbers, what
  shipped in the codebase lately plus what's still open, and the business
  summary (unit economics, break-even) — then closes with a verdict: what's
  overdue, what's off target, and 1-3 concrete actions for the week ahead.
  Invoke on "/check-up", or when Davide asks how the business is going,
  wants a status check, a pulse check, a health check, or "where do things
  stand". Also runs automatically every Sunday via a scheduled routine (see
  "The weekly routine" below) — when invoked that way there is no chat to
  reply into, so deliver by email instead of narrating.

# casdey check-up

One pass across every part of the business, read live from the actual
sources, not from memory or from `CLAUDE.md` (which is a decision record, not
a live dashboard, and goes stale between sessions). Built 2026-09-11 at
Davide's request, output "both" (chat summary + a redeployed artifact link
each run) and cadence "on-demand + every Sunday" — see the two scripts and
the artifact this skill maintains for how that's wired.

**Audience: Davide and Claude both, not Davide alone (Davide, 2026-09-13).**
This isn't a report to skim and file away — it's the shared, current picture
of the business that any casdey session (interactive or a cloud routine)
should treat as live context for deciding what to work on next, the same way
`CLAUDE.md` is treated as the decision record. When a session opens and
Davide wants to continue casdey work without saying exactly what, checking
whether a check-up artifact exists and reading its "Signals & recommended
actions" (section 5 below) is a reasonable way to ground that, the same way
this session read `web/SAAS_V1_PLAN.md` for open tracks. Write section 5
accordingly: concrete and specific enough (file paths, track names, tab
names) that a fresh Claude session with no other context could pick one of
its actions up and start, not just a headline a human would nod at.

## The four sections, and where each number comes from

1. **Marketing** — the `Casdey-Gym-Leads` sheet (id
   `1WOAIA1gvK6S1kWe_Vf4-d4XmjhnDLQZLtyU_ezvOu3w`, see `CLAUDE.md` "Stage 1
   progress"), read live via `web/scripts/check-up-marketing.mjs`
   (`npm run checkup:marketing` from `web/`). Same service-account JWT
   pattern the outreach routines already write with
   (`casdey-routine@casdey-gws-cli.iam.gserviceaccount.com`), read-only scope
   (`spreadsheets.readonly`), so this can never touch a live send. Covers:
   - `leads` — status breakdown off the `Leads` tab (Not contacted / Contacted
     / Replied / Interested / Committed / Dead), contacted count, reply rate.
   - `sendLog` — rows off the `Send Log` tab, bucketed by the `Variant`
     column into first-touch (A/B) vs follow-up-1 vs follow-up-2 sends (each
     actual send is its own row; the `Follow-up Sent (Y/N)` columns are a
     per-lead summary flag, not a send count — count rows, not flags), plus
     the CTA variant (A/B) and subject-line variant (S1/S2) splits, plus a
     `sentThisWeek` cut. Sends before the Variant column existed (pre
     2026-09-02) land in `rowTypeCounts.other`, not a bug.
   - `igOutreach` — the `IG Outreach` tab: sends, this-week sends, replies.
   - `testLog` — whatever's in the `Test Log` tab as-is (the weekly test
     review is still a manual Davide+Claude session that fills in the
     Sends/Replies/Winner columns by hand, per `CLAUDE.md` "Marketing plan" —
     this just surfaces the current standing, it does not run that review).

2. **Numbers** (product + revenue + traffic) — `web/scripts/check-up-numbers.mjs`
   (`npm run checkup:numbers`). Three sources in one script:
   - **Supabase**, over the REST API (`@supabase/supabase-js`,
     `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — same as `supabaseAdmin()`
     in `src/lib/supabase.ts`), **not** a direct `pg` connection: gyms (real
     vs `is_internal`, paying, trialing, new this week, tier split), product
     usage (members, returned, approved campaigns, messages sent, bookings,
     revenue recovered), and the waitlist count. Always filter `is_internal`
     out of anything presented as a real business number — see
     `admin-stats.ts` for why that flag exists (2026-09-08, `0035`/`0036`:
     `/admin` was once counting internal test gyms as paying customers).
     **Why REST and not `pg`:** the first version connected straight to the
     Postgres pooler (`SUPABASE_DB_URL`) and worked locally, but the weekly
     routine's cloud sandbox timed out on that raw TCP connection every
     time (found 2026-09-12) — its network proxy only carries HTTPS-shaped
     traffic, which is also why Stripe and PostHog (both plain HTTPS APIs)
     worked from the same sandbox without issue. Switching to Supabase's own
     REST API fixed it outright, no sandbox networking change needed.
   - **Stripe** (live key, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE`): active/trialing
     subscription counts and an approximate MRR (price unit amount,
     annual ÷ 12, coupon applied — approximate, not the accounting figure).
     **Cross-check this against the DB's `is_internal` flag before reporting
     it as real MRR.** Stripe has no concept of an internal test gym, so an
     active internal subscription (e.g. a stress-test account, or one left
     running past a walkthrough) inflates the raw Stripe number silently.
     Seen live on 2026-09-11: Stripe reported 1 active sub / ~€99 MRR while
     the DB's paying count (which excludes `is_internal`) read 0 — that one
     sub was the internal "Test Admin" gym, not a customer. State the real
     (non-internal) paying count from the DB as the headline figure, and
     mention the Stripe total only as a footnote when it disagrees.
   - **PostHog** (cookieless, EU): 7-day visitors + pageviews via the same
     HogQL host-rewrite `posthog-query.ts` uses (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
     with `.i.posthog.com` → `.posthog.com`, `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID` +
     `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` against the private query API).

3. **Engineering / software** — no script, read directly:
   - `git log --since="7 days ago" --oneline` (repo root) for what actually
     shipped. Group by area (web feature, migration, plan/doc, skill) rather
     than listing raw commit lines.
   - `web/SAAS_V1_PLAN.md` and `web/SAAS_V1_1_PLAN.md` for what's still open —
     read the status tables/track headers, don't re-litigate the reasoning
     inside each track. `SAAS_V1_1_PLAN.md` is the current phase (V1 shipped
     2026-09-07); `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md` §7's board is now historical.
   - Any `Deferred`/`Still open`/`Not done` bullets flagged in `CLAUDE.md`
     itself are fair game too, but don't re-read the whole file every run —
     the plan docs are the maintained source for open items.

4. **Business overview** — read `casdey-hq.md` at the repo root directly
   (it's already the short, current-state summary: the offer, prices, cost
   table, unit economics, break-even, "Where it stands", and "Open"). Don't
   recompute unit economics here, just reflect what it says and flag if a
   number in it looks stale against what sections 1-3 just found (e.g. if it
   says "Paying customers: 0" but Numbers just found 1, that document is due
   an edit — say so, don't silently carry the contradiction).

5. **Signals & recommended actions — synthesized, not sourced.** Distinct
   from the four above: nothing here comes from an API, it's what the other
   four sections mean taken together. Skipping it (or reducing it to a
   generic "keep going") defeats the point of running this weekly — a
   snapshot with no verdict is trivia, not a check-up. This section is what
   makes the check-up worth Davide's attention rather than something he
   skims past: the four data sections say what happened, this says what to
   do about it.

   Always run these specific checks, since they recur and are easy to miss
   just by eyeballing the raw numbers:
   - **Weekly A/B test review cadence** (`CLAUDE.md` "Marketing plan"): the
     `Test Log` tab's most recently filled-in review is due every Sunday.
     If it's more than 7 days old, say so explicitly and by how many days
     overdue — this slipped silently for over a week before 2026-09-12, and
     nobody noticed until a check-up said it out loud instead of just
     listing the tab's contents.
   - **Engagement rate vs the stated 3% target** (`CLAUDE.md` "Marketing
     plan", set 2026-09-02): state the gap in percentage points, not just
     the raw rate on its own.
   - **`casdey-hq.md` vs what Numbers/Marketing just found**: already
     flagged in section 4 above — surface it again here if it changes what
     Davide should actually do (e.g. a real paying gym now exists but the
     doc still says "0 paying customers", which is worth a `/update-project`
     pass, not just a footnote).
   - **Plan-doc items stuck across multiple runs**: before overwriting the
     artifact, `Artifact action:"read"` the current version (already a
     required step below) and compare its open-items/action list against
     what this run just found in `SAAS_V1_PLAN.md`/`SAAS_V1_1_PLAN.md`. An
     item that reads "still open"/"todo" two check-ups running is itself a
     signal worth naming, distinct from an item that's simply new this week.

   Close with **1-3 ranked, concrete actions**, addressed to Davide
   directly, in imperative language ("Run the T0/T1 weekly review, it's N
   days overdue" not "the review could be looked at sometime"). Order by
   leverage, not by section order, and when Hormozi's framing genuinely
   applies (More/Better/New, the Value Equation, LTGP:CAC) name it, the way
   `.claude/skills/hormozi/` already does elsewhere — don't force it onto
   something that's just an ops gap. If nothing rises to the level of an
   action this week, say that plainly ("no action needed, still running
   clean") rather than inventing busywork: a check-up that always finds
   three things to worry about stops being trusted the moment nothing is
   actually wrong.

## Composing the output

**Chat summary** (every on-demand run): lead with section 5's ranked actions
(or its "no action needed" line), not buried at the end — that's the part
worth reading first. Then short, headline numbers only, one or two lines of
takeaway per section, and call out anything that looks wrong or
contradictory across sources (the Stripe-vs-`is_internal` MRR check above is
exactly this kind of thing). End with the artifact link.

**Artifact** (every run, on-demand or weekly): the fuller version, one page,
all five sections, with the actual figures rather than just the takeaway.
Give section 5 its own clearly separated block (not folded into the
Business section) since it's the part both Davide and a future Claude
session should be able to find at a glance. Load `artifact-design` before
writing it, same as any artifact. Keep it skimmable on a phone, since
that's the point of publishing it rather than only printing to chat.

**Same URL every time.** Before publishing, check whether this skill has
already published one: `Artifact action:"list"` and look for the title
"casdey check-up" (or read the URL noted below, once one exists). If found,
`action:"read"` it first (the tool requires reading before republishing to a
URL this session hasn't touched), then publish to that same `url` so it
redeploys in place rather than creating a new artifact. If this is genuinely
the first run ever, publish fresh and then **edit this file** to record the
URL in the line below, so every future run (including the unattended weekly
one) knows where to redeploy without having to search:

> **Artifact URL:** https://claude.ai/code/artifact/e527486a-6a23-4267-8d4e-f9722adbdbbe
> (first published 2026-09-11)

## The weekly routine

Runs automatically every Sunday via a scheduled Claude Routine (set up with
the `schedule` skill, same mechanism as the two outreach routines in
`CLAUDE.md` "Stage 1 progress" — this is a third one, not part of either
existing outreach routine). It has no chat to reply into, so the delivery
step is different from an on-demand run:

0. **`cd web && npm ci` first.** A cloud routine's checkout has no
   `node_modules` (found the hard way on the first live run, 2026-09-11:
   `checkup:numbers` failed with `Cannot find package 'pg'`). Local runs
   already have it installed, so this is a no-op there.
1. Do everything above (all five sections including the recommended
   actions, compose chat-style summary text, publish/redeploy the artifact).
2. Instead of printing the summary to a conversation, write it to a temp
   file and send it by email:
   `node scripts/send-email.mjs davide@casdey.com "casdey check-up — <date>" <path>`
   (`web/scripts/send-email.mjs`, the same Zoho OAuth account
   `src/lib/zoho-mail.ts` already sends from). Put the artifact link at the
   top of the email body, then the recommended actions, then the same
   headline-numbers summary.

Set up once via `/schedule`, weekly, Sunday. **All three casdey routines now
fire at the same `02:00` UTC slot (2026-09-13, Davide's call: 4am Italian
time so the 5-hour usage window resets by ~9am, before he starts working)**
— they run as independent cloud sessions in separate environments, so this
is fine operationally, just worth knowing if their reports/emails ever land
suspiciously close together. See `CLAUDE.md` "Infrastructure" for the
pattern (`RemoteTrigger`, not a repo cron).

**Credentials in a cloud routine.** A routine runs in its own cloud
checkout, with no `web/.env.local` and no local service-account key file, so
all three scripts (`check-up-marketing.mjs`, `check-up-numbers.mjs`,
`send-email.mjs`) read `process.env` first and only fall back to
`.env.local` for local runs. The Google service-account key specifically
needs `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (the key file's raw contents) set as an
env var on whichever cloud environment the routine uses — a path
(`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`) only works locally. If a weekly run's email
never arrives, `RemoteTrigger action:"list_runs"` then `get_run_log` on it
first — a missing env var on the routine's environment is the most likely
failure, not a bug in the scripts.

**Confirmed working end to end, 2026-09-12.** The `casdey-Outreach`
environment (`env_016U3DW3QNJS1t7AyukzK5RN`) now carries all of
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE`,
`POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID`, `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`,
on top of the `ZOHO_*`/`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` it already had, plus a
Setup script (`cd web && npm ci`) so `node_modules` exists before the skill's
own steps run. A live routine run that morning confirmed all four sections
populate with real data and the email sends cleanly.

## What this deliberately does not do

- It does not run the weekly outreach A/B test review (picking a winner,
  updating the `Test Log` tab) — that stays the manual Davide+Claude session
  `CLAUDE.md`'s "Marketing plan" describes. This skill only surfaces the
  current standing (and, per section 5, whether that review is overdue).
- It does not edit `CLAUDE.md`, the plan docs, or `casdey-hq.md` — it reads
  them. Use `/update-project` for that, separately, if a check-up surfaces
  something worth recording.
- It does not write to the outreach sheet, Stripe, or Supabase. Every source
  above is read-only.
- **Section 5 recommends, it does not execute.** Naming an overdue review or
  a stuck plan item is not the same as doing it — that still needs an
  explicit follow-through, by Davide or in a separate session/turn, the same
  as any other finding this skill surfaces. Adding the recommendations
  section does not loosen the read-only rule above.
