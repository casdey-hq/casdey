/**
 * The founder-only gate for /admin.
 *
 * casdey is a one-person business (see CLAUDE.md "Stage 1"), so there is no
 * staff/internal role to check against in the database, only a fixed
 * allowlist of emails. It lives in an env var rather than a hardcoded string
 * so it can be widened without a code change, the same reasoning as
 * trialEnabledForNewSignups() in ./plan.ts.
 *
 * This is the real boundary, checked on every request. src/proxy.ts's /admin
 * match is the same convenience redirect it already does for /app: it keeps a
 * signed-out visitor from ever reaching the render, it is not what makes the
 * route safe.
 *
 * The default covers both of Davide's own addresses, not just davide@casdey.com:
 * his day-to-day dev/testing login is his personal Gmail
 * (07davide.longo@gmail.com, see CLAUDE.md's userEmail), which would
 * otherwise get bounced to /app on his own machine. info@casdey.com was added
 * on 2026-09-19 at his request: it is casdey's own business account, and he
 * signs in with it through Google.
