/**
 * Drains the send queue.
 *
 * Called on a schedule rather than in a request, because sending a campaign
 * takes minutes to days and nobody is going to hold a browser tab open for it.
 *
 * Every message passes four checks before it leaves, in this order, because
 * each one is a different way of emailing somebody we must not email:
 *
 *   1. The gym is still paying. A cancelled account stops sending.
 *   2. The campaign is still approved and running.
 *   3. The address is not suppressed. Checked here and not only at queue time,
 *      because somebody can unsubscribe in between.
 *   4. The member still exists and still consents.
 *
 * **How much this can actually deliver in a day**, because the product makes a
 * promise about it and the two numbers have to agree.
 *
 * The queue used to be read one page of 25 at a time and the run then stopped,
 * whatever time was left. On Vercel Hobby the cron fires once a day, so the
 * whole deployment sent 25 messages a day, while each gym's daily_send_cap
 * said 50 and the campaign screen told the gym "about N days" based on that
 * 50. Every campaign therefore took at least twice as long as the gym was
 * told, and a 200-member list quietly became eight days instead of four.
 *
 * A run now keeps going until the queue is empty or it is nearly out of time,
 * so one daily run delivers what the caps allow rather than one page of them.
 * The per-gym daily ceiling is still enforced below and is still the thing
 * that paces a campaign.
 *
 * Two ceilings sit above all of this and neither is in this file:
 *   - Vercel Hobby allows each cron to run once a day. Since 2026-09-19 the
 *     drain has five daily schedules (web/vercel.json), and each gym sends
 *     only in the ones that fall in its own daytime (src/lib/send-window.ts),
 *     so a US gym's members are not emailed at 11pm.
 *   - Resend is on Pro since 2026-09-07 (50,000 a month, no daily cap), shared
 *     with the cold outreach.
