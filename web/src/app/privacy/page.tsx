/*
 * Scope note: this notice covers the *waitlist* only, i.e. the details a
 * gym gives us on casdey.com before it has an account. Processing of member
 * records, once a gym signs up and imports its list, is a separate matter
 * covered by /terms/processing (src/app/terms/processing/page.tsx), which now
 * exists and is live. Updated 2026-08-24: the body text used to say "casdey
 * does not hold any member data yet", accurate while only the waitlist was
 * public but false now that /app is live and a real gym can sign up and
 * import a real CSV today. Fixed to point at the processing terms instead of
 * asserting something no longer true.
 *
 * Controller identity (updated 2026-09-01): stated as "casdey, operated by the
 * casdey team" with info@casdey.com as the contact, Davide's explicit early-stage
 * choice. A registered legal/trading entity and a postal address are deliberately
 * deferred until casdey has a registered entity (no P.IVA yet); email-only contact
 * is a defensible pre-entity choice for a waitlist notice under UK/EU GDPR art. 13.
 *
 * Analytics disclosure added 2026-09-08: PostHog (EU Cloud, cookieless) was
 * wired into the whole site that day, and "no analytics that profiles you"
 * under "What we collect" would otherwise sit here false. It is site-wide,
 * not waitlist-specific, so it gets its own section rather than being folded
 * into the waitlist scope this page otherwise keeps to. It never touches
 * member data, which is why it is not in /terms/processing's sub-processor
 * list: no member name, email, or phone number is ever sent to PostHog.

              This notice covers the details you give us when you join the

            <H2>Who we are</H2>
            <P>
              casdey, operated by the casdey team, is the controller of the
              information described here. You can reach us at{" "}
              <a
                href="mailto:info@casdey.com"
                className="text-teal underline decoration-ash underline-offset-4 hover:decoration-teal"

              about anything on this page, including any of the rights listed
              below.
            </P>

            <H2>What we collect</H2>
            <P>
              Only what the waitlist form asks for: your gym name, your work
              email address, and optionally the gym software you use. We also
              record the date you joined. There are no advertising cookies and
              nothing here is sold or shared for anyone else&apos;s marketing.
            </P>

            <H2>Analytics on this website</H2>
            <P>
              We use PostHog, hosted in the EU, to see roughly how many people
              visit casdey.com, which pages they land on, and roughly which
              country a visit comes from. The country is worked out by our
              hosting provider from your connection, or from your
              browser&apos;s time zone, and only the country is passed on: your
              IP address is not sent to PostHog or stored. It runs
              cookieless: no cookie is set, nothing is written to your
              browser&apos;s storage, and you are counted by a rotating,
              privacy-preserving hash PostHog computes on its own servers
              rather than an identifier tied to you personally. That is also
              why there is no cookie banner: nothing is stored on your device
              to ask permission for. It is not used for advertising, does not
              follow you to other websites, and is never linked to your
              waitlist entry.
            </P>

            <H2>Why we collect it</H2>
            <P>
              To email you about casdey and your free first week, and to decide
              which gym software to support first. Our lawful basis is your
              consent, given by submitting the form for that stated purpose. You
              can withdraw it at any time and we will delete your entry.
            </P>

            <H2>What we will not do with it</H2>
            <P>
              We will not sell it, rent it, share it with third parties for
              their own purposes, send you a newsletter, or use it to contact
              you about anything other than casdey&apos;s launch and the free
              first week.
            </P>

            <H2>How long we keep it</H2>
            <P>
              Until casdey launches and you have either become a customer or
              told us you are not interested, and in any case no longer than 24
              months from the day you joined. After that the entry is deleted.
            </P>

            <H2>Where it is kept, and who else sees it</H2>
            <P>
              Your entry is stored in a database hosted in the EU. Three
              providers process it on our behalf, under contract, and none of
              them may use it for anything of their own: Supabase, which hosts
              the database, Vercel, which serves this website, and Zoho, which
              sends the emails. That is the whole list, and we will tell you if
              it changes.
            </P>

            <H2>Your rights</H2>
            <P>
              You can ask us for a copy of what we hold about you, correct it,
              delete it, restrict or object to how we use it, or have it sent to
              you in a portable format. Email info@casdey.com and we will action
              it within one month, usually much faster. If you are unhappy with
              how we have handled it you can complain to your national data
              protection authority, which in the UK is the Information
              Commissioner&apos;s Office.
            </P>

            <H2>Changes</H2>
            <P>
              If this notice changes in a way that affects you, we will email
              everyone on the waitlist rather than quietly update the page.
            </P>
