    q: "Can I get a refund?",
    a: "Only through the Pro guarantee. If your first 30-day window on Pro does not recover more than it cost, you claim a full refund of what you paid in it, from your billing page. Everything else is paid in advance and non-refundable: cancelling stops the next renewal and keeps you on the plan until the period you have paid for runs out.
