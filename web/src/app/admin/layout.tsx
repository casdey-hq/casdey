 * The founder-only shell.

 * Deliberately not nested under src/app/app/layout.tsx: that shell reads a
 * single gym for its sidebar, and this page is cross-gym by design. It shares
 * the same product.css and component set so it reads as the same product,
 * not a bolted-on tool.
 *
 * requireAdmin() here is a convenience, same caveat as AppLayout's own
 * comment: layouts do not re-render on client navigation and cannot stop a
 * segment below them from rendering. The real gate is requireAdmin() called
 * again in page.tsx. Belt and braces costs nothing on a route only one person
 * ever opens.
